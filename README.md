This project provides an Apollo-based autonomous driving simulation platform [[Baidu Apollo EM Motion Planner](/https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.08048.pdf)].
The software version used in this project is: CarSim2019.0+PreScan8.3.0+MatlabR2021a


To run correctly, first open the dynamic model with CarSim and then open the experiment with PreScan.

Note that Matlab must be opened with PreScan, and dynamic model is not provided
Run emplanner_init.m to initialize the simulink model.
Run simulink simulation.
